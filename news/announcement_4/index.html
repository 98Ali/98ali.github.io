Established in 2022 within the vibrant ecosystem of the Student Research Committee (SRC), NAIRG has since flourished, aligning with the Department of Neuroscience, under the School of Science and Advanced Technologies in Medicine.</p> <p>NAIRG stands as a singular entity within UMSHA, dedicated to propelling the boundaries of knowledge and practical applications in neuroscience and AI. The inception of this group was a response to the burgeoning need for interdisciplinary research that can unravel the intricacies of the human brain through the lens of advanced computational technologies.</p> <p>The journey of NAIRG, marked by collaborative spirit and relentless pursuit of excellence, has been made possible by the unwavering support and cooperation of Dr. Arman Gorji. Together, we have catalyzed the groupâ€™s dynamic progression, establishing a robust foundation for pioneering research that promises to shape the future of medical sciences.</p> </body></html>
