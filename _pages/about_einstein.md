I vividly remember it was a summer afternoon; we were in the Allameh Helli High School animal laboratory in Tehran when I found my first magic signal from a rat brain with a kit we designed! It was the beginning spark of my love for research in neuroscience, especially computational neuroscience. A few years later, I learned more about brain signals and brain data processing. After starting my medical education in Hamadan, I continued my love of research at the Neurophysiological Research Center at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.
