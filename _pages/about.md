I vividly remember it was a summer afternoon; we were in the Allameh Helli High School animal laboratory in Tehran when I found my first magic signal from a rat brain with a kit we designed! It was the beginning spark of my love for research in neuroscience, especially computational neuroscience. A few years later, I learned more about brain signals and brain data processing. After starting my medical education in Hamadan, I continued my love of research at the Neurophysiological Research Center at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. I found skills in behavioural tests, electrophysiology, and introduction to animal models in this research center at my university. Besides, I learned many computational neuroscience and neuroimaging lessons at Neuromatch Academy and Coursera, which have helped me become more proficient in this field. An important event for me was attending the IEEE Brain 2020 School, where my colleagues and I presented a project based on SSVEP-based BCI, which helped me understand neuroscience data and computational models. At the same time, I continued my primary interest in brain data processing and computational neuroscience through self-education and participating in courses at the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML) and the Center for Convergent Technologies at the University of Tehran and other scientific institutes. I gained computer software skills such as MATLAB, Python, and R and skills for processing brain images and signals such as fMRI and EEG Processing. Besides studying medicine, I took a one-year data science course (365 hours) at the University of Tehran to improve my programming skills in Python, statistical analysis methods, and especially AI techniques. The NBML provided me with a month of full-time internship at the image processing Lab in NBML; this internship helped me learn how neuroscience concepts work from cells to the whole brain and improve my neuroimaging skills. Also, I continued my research on electroencephalography and brain stimulation at the Five Senses Health Research Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences.
