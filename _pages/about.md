Iâ€™m Ali Fathi Jouzdani, MD and researcher. From the moment I captured that first magical signal from a rat's brain in the animal laboratory of Allameh Helli High School, I knew that neuroscience, particularly computational neuroscience, was my way. That summer afternoon in Tehran sparked a journey of discovery and innovation that has since become my life's work.

My academic path led me to Hamadan, where I pursued medical education while deepening my research expertise at the Neurophysiological Research Center of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. There, I honed my skills in behavioral tests, electrophysiology, and the use of animal models, laying a solid foundation for my future endeavors.

Eager to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, I immersed myself in advanced courses at the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML), the Center for Convergent Technologies at the University of Tehran, and other prestigious scientific institutions, including Neuromatch. This diverse educational tapestry enriched my proficiency in computational tools such as MATLAB, Python, and R, and equipped me with the expertise to process complex brain data, including fMRI and EEG.

Committed to excellence, I completed a rigorous one-year data science program at the University of Tehran, where I further refined my programming skills and delved into the intricacies of statistical analysis and artificial intelligence techniques.

My dedication to neuroscience led to a full-time internship at the image processing Lab in NBML, where I explored the intricate workings of neuroscience, from MRI data gathering to complex analysis, to identify neural networks and circuits, significantly enhancing my neuroimaging capabilities.

Currently, I am researching Neurosurgery (especially Functional Neurosurgery and Neuro-Oncology), Brain Stimulation, and Precision Medicine. I hope each step of this journey continues to fuel my passion for uncovering the mysteries of the brain and harnessing the power of computational neuroscience to improve lives.
